## 🧠 Abstract

Fingerprint matching is one of the most widely used biometric authentication methods. This project integrates **AI techniques** with Python to build a fingerprint matching system that can:
- Compare fingerprint images
- Classify match vs. no-match
- Handle real-world noise and variations

It uses traditional **feature extraction** (minutiae, ridge flow) and modern **deep learning models** (CNNs, Siamese Networks) for robust performance.

2. **Preprocessing** – Grayscale, normalization, enhancement, filtering
3. **Feature Extraction**
   - Minutiae (ridges, bifurcations)
   - CNN-based auto-features
4. **Model Training**
   - SVM, Random Forest
   - CNN / Siamese Network
5. **Evaluation**
